Hi there 👋


🔭 I’m currently working on:
Building modern web applications using ASP.NET Core, C#, Angular, and Entity Framework, while exploring ways to integrate AI features into full-stack apps.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
.NET-based web or desktop applications, and beginner-friendly projects that combine AI/ML with .NET or Python.

🤝 I’m looking for help with:
Best practices for integrating AI models (LLMs, ML.NET, or OpenAI APIs) into enterprise-grade .NET applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning:

Machine Learning basics with Python and ML.NET

OpenAI, LangChain, and LLM integrations with .NET APIs

Deep diving into Blazor, Microservices, and cloud-native .NET deployments

💬 Ask me about:

Full-stack development using .NET 6/7, C#, Angular, EF Core, REST APIs

How to start adding AI into your .NET workflows

Deploying apps with Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure/AWS

⚡ Fun fact:
I’m always curious about how AI can make software smarter — from auto-tagging images to generating code snippets — and I love turning that curiosity into side projects!
